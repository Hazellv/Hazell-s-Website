  <p id="info2">As I grew up I realized that my passions are connected to the arts. I enjoy creativity and expressing it either by drawing or through writing. Yet, I love the idea of creating characters and seeing them move on screen. This is how I became interested in being part of the video game industry. I want to customise and design characters and bring them to life, for players can enjoy. I as well want to focus on software development, in order to understand the whole process of how a video game can run thorugh it's coding. This way I can have a wide knowledge of how a system is programmed and the coding behind designing video game characters.</p>
